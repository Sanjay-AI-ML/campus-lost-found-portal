  "summary": "The diff implements a Motoko-based finder trust/credit score system. Most requirements are addressed: finder profiles in a 'finders' map, credit score incremented on claim approval, items sorted by credit score, getFinders endpoint, and frontend badge display. However, there are notable deviations from the spec: badge tier thresholds differ from requirements, a Platinum tier is added (not requested), and the backend returns plain Item arrays rather than attaching finder_credit_score/finder_badge fields to the item payload as specified in REQ-15.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Include finder_credit_score (int) and finder_badge (string) fields attached to each found item in the GET /items response payload, so the frontend can render the badge without a separate fetch.",
      "reason": "The backend's getItemsWithFinder returns [Item] (plain Item array) rather than a composite type with finder_credit_score and finder_badge embedded in each item record. The ItemWithFinder type exists internally but is not exposed as the return type; the frontend resolves credit scores separately via a FinderMap from a parallel getFinders call, not from fields embedded in the item payload.",
